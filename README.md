# Klados

[![Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/7103131.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/7103131)

Klados allows users to curate [phyloreferences]
side-by-side with the phylogenies they were originally defined on. The curated phylogenies
are stored in the [Phyx format], which can be downloaded as an [OWL 2 ontology]
in the [JSON-LD format]. Phyx files can be incorporated into the [Clade Ontology].
